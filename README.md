# PR214_ADS-B
This project achieves real-time reception, decryption, sorting, and display of ADS-B frames on a web page. Using a receiver module, frames are captured, decrypted for flight data, and sorted by aircraft ID. The sorted data is then presented on a web interface, showing live aircraft positions and path on a map with detailed flight information.

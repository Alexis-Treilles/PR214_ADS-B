# PR214_ADS-B

This project, conducted by six students from the electronic engineering program at ENSEIRB-MATMECA, achieves real-time reception, decryption, sorting, and display of ADS-B frames on a web page. Using a receiver module, frames are captured, decrypted for flight data, and sorted by aircraft ID. The sorted data is then presented on a web interface, showing live aircraft positions and paths on a map with detailed flight information.
